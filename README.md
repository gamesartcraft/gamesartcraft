- 👋 Hi, I'm Lucas (@gamesartcraft).
- 👀 I'm interested in programs like Vita3k, Cassia, Strato (Nintendo Switch Emulator) and Develop projects involving Mali GPUs for improvements (or anything else).
- 🌱 I'm currently learning JavaScript, but I plan to learn many programming languages. For as long as I've been at school studying.
- 💞️ I try to collaborate with projects like Vita3k, Cassia and Strato (Nintendo Switch Emulator) and I can possibly support other projects.
- 📫 For now I don't have any contact email.
- 📖 However, I'm not working with these things at the moment, as I'm still at school, but I really intend to contribute and help improve these projects mentioned before, and I intend to make my projects myself by contributing to the modding community .
- 🙂 I may update this repository with more information.
