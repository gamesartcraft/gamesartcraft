- 👋 Hi, I'm Lucas (@gamesartcraft).
- 👀 I'm interested in programs like Vita3k, Cassia, Strato (Nintendo Switch Emulator) and Developing projects involving Mali GPUs for improvements (or anything else).
- 🌱 I'm currently learning JavaScript, but I intend to learn a lot of programming languages while I'm still at school.
- 💞️ I want to try to collaborate with projects like Vita3k, Cassia and Strato (Nintendo Switch Emulator) and I may eventually support other projects.
- 📫 I don't have a contact email address at the moment.
- 📖 However, I'm not working on these things at the moment, as I'm still at school, but I very much intend to contribute and help improve these aforementioned projects, and I intend to make my own projects by contributing to the modding community .
- 🙂 I'll try to keep this repository updated with more information.
